🧩 RogueSim Gameplay Enhancement Plan — Phase II: Depth & Community
1. 🕵️‍♂️ Social Engineering Module
Goal: Bring mind games and deception into play.

🔹 Social Engineered Missions
Convince NPCs to give up info, passwords, or access

Use keyword prompts or fake profiles in a simulated email/chat interface

🔹 Phishing Toolkit
Create fake login pages

Deploy them as missions against other players or AI targets

Gain “intel” as a resource for other missions

2. 🧬 Dynamic Network System
Goal: Create procedural and persistent systems to hack.

🔸 Network Map Generator
Procedurally generates:

Firewalls

Subnets

Honeytraps

Privilege escalators

🔸 Persistent Backdoors
Leave a dormant exploit in a server for later

Risk: may be discovered or patched by AI

🔸 Traceback System
Risk of being traced during missions based on:

Command volume

Time spent

Skill tree modifiers

3. 📡 RogueNet (Player-Driven Dark Web)
Goal: Let players shape the world.

🔹 Player-Built Market
Sell custom tools, scripts, upgrades

Use in-game currency or bartering

🔹 Message Board
Post public mission contracts

Optional “rogue bounties” (PvP kill orders)

🔹 RogueNet Handles
Players have unique IDs visible only in RogueNet (like darknet usernames)

4. ⚙️ Advanced Terminal Scripting
Goal: Add power-user capabilities for automation.

🔸 Script Runner
Write small routines in a Lua-style DSL or JSON-based flow

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "if": "scan_success",
  "then": ["inject_exploit", "trigger_logwipe"]
}
🔸 Macro Commands
Bind multiple commands to a single alias

alias intrude="ping && nmap && inject_payload"

5. 🧠 Psych Profile & Alignment System
Goal: Let the player’s behavior affect the story.

🔹 Ethics Tracker
Player actions rated on:

Collateral damage

Data integrity

Civilian impact

🔹 Resulting Perks
Pure: gain trust missions from AI protectors

Corrupt: gain high-reward missions from syndicates

Balanced: unlock unique multi-faction missions

6. 🌐 Cross-Mission World Events
Goal: Make the game feel alive and global.

🔸 Global Events
"Server Outbreak" — everyone gets mission variants tied to a common storyline

"Patch Week" — forces players to change tactics due to security updates

🔸 Leaderboard Shifts
Events can disrupt or flip standings based on response speed or success

7. 🧠 Mental Load + Focus Mechanic
Goal: Introduce tension and pacing.

🔸 Focus Meter
Each action costs focus

Overload causes command delays or hallucination-like effects in UI

🔸 Restore Focus
Through breaks, stimulants (in-game items), or “Deep Focus Mode”

8. 🎭 Simulated OS Modes
Goal: Let players simulate full OS environments for deeper immersion.

🔹 Modes
BasicShell – standard command line

GhostOS – stealth-mode interface

CrimsonKernel – high power, high risk

Each has its own UI, quirks, vulnerabilities, and advantages.
