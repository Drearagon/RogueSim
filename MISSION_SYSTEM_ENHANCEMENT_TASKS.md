# Mission System Streamlining & Scaling Tasks

This document collects tasks to refactor and extend the current mission implementation. The goal is to make missions modular, easier to manage, and capable of scaling with player progression.

## 1. Centralize Mission Data
- Extract the hard‑coded templates from `server/missionGenerator.ts` and `client/src/lib/missions.ts` into JSON or TypeScript data files under a new `missions/` directory.
- Keep a single source of truth for mission definitions so both the server and client consume the same data.

## 2. Modular Mission Builder
- Implement a mission builder service that loads mission templates and assembles missions based on player level and history. The current `StaticMissionGenerator` shows the basic pattern:
  ```ts
  export class StaticMissionGenerator {
      async generateMission(playerLevel: number, completedMissions: string[], reputation: string): Promise<MissionTemplate> {
          const baseDifficulty = Math.min(playerLevel * 0.5 + 1, 10);
          const difficultyVariance = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
          const finalDifficulty = Math.max(1, Math.min(10, baseDifficulty + difficultyVariance));
          return this.createMission(playerLevel, finalDifficulty, completedMissions);
      }
  }
  ```
- Split the mission creation logic into smaller functions (difficulty calculation, template selection, reward calculation) so each step can be tested in isolation.

## 3. Mission Generation API
- The server already exposes `/api/missions/generate` and `/api/missions/generate-batch` for mission creation【F:server/routes.ts†L571-L612】. After refactoring, adjust these routes to use the new mission builder and allow requesting mission categories or difficulty ranges.

## 4. Database Storage for Missions
- Add tables or JSON columns to persist generated missions. Saving generated missions will allow resuming in-progress missions and analyzing completion statistics.
- Store `missionHistory` records using the existing schema in `shared/schema.ts`.

## 5. Scalable Mission Types
- Consolidate the procedural mission logic defined in `client/src/lib/missions.ts` into reusable generators. Example dynamic missions include complex branch points and timed choices【F:client/src/lib/missions.ts†L320-L404】.
- Support chained missions where the outcome of one mission generates follow‑up operations.
- Incorporate the dynamic network system and social engineering module from the Phase II plan to add variety and scaling difficulty.

## 6. Progress Tracking & Branching
- Provide a unified progress tracker so the mission panel can show status consistently. The mission panel currently computes progress locally based on steps【F:client/src/components/MissionPanel.tsx†L20-L32】.
- Expose mission branch choices and consequences over the API, enabling multiplayer teams to share decisions.

## 7. Testing & Validation
- Write unit tests for mission generation and progress functions.
- Add integration tests to verify the mission API endpoints return valid missions and save history correctly.

## 8. Example New Missions
- Create high‑level templates such as "Quantum Firewall Breach" and "Neural Nexus Assault" that scale enemy AI defenses with player level.
- Provide low‑level tutorial missions to introduce new mechanics gradually.

Implementing these tasks will unify mission logic, reduce duplication, and allow the mission system to grow with future features.
