# Command Unlock System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented and validated a comprehensive command unlock system for your RogueSim game. This ensures that commands are properly categorized and unlocked through the appropriate mechanisms (missions, shop purchases, or faction progression).

## System Architecture

### Command Availability Function
- Added `isCommandAvailable(commandName, gameState)` function that checks:
  - Always available commands (help, clear, status, shop, etc.)
  - Player level requirements
  - Shop-purchased unlocks
  - Faction-exclusive commands

### Command Categories

#### Always Available (0 commands)
These commands are accessible without any unlocks through the `isCommandAvailable` function.

#### Level 0 - Starter Commands (15 commands)
Available from the beginning of the game:
- `easter`, `help`, `connect`, `mission`, `complete`
- `multiplayer`, `leaderboard`, `devmode`, `tutorial`, `settings`
- `skills`, `skill_buy`, `skill_list`, `skill_info`, `skill_bonuses`

#### Level 1 Commands (9 commands)
Unlocked through early mission progression:
- `trace`, `nmap`, `minigame`, `crack_pattern`
- `mg_input`, `mg_move`, `mg_nav`, `rep`, `factions`

#### Level 2 Commands (7 commands)
Unlocked through intermediate missions:
- `status`, `inject`, `exploit`, `recon`
- `trace_signal`, `faction`, `faction_mission`

#### Level 3 Commands (13 commands)
Unlocked through advanced missions:
- `bypass`, `reboot`, `clear`, `man`, `frequency`
- `decrypt`, `choose`, `reset_shop`, `hydra`
- `backdoor`, `shop`, `phish`, `navigate_tree`

#### Shop Exclusive Commands (11 commands)
Must be purchased from the shop:
- `extract_data`, `file_recovery`, `extended_scan`, `wifi_monitor`
- `iot_hack`, `sensor_spoof`, `scan`, `spoof`
- `test`, `crack`, `keylog`

#### Faction Exclusive Commands (3 commands)
Unlocked through faction progression:
- `ghost_mode`, `overload_system`, `deep_fake`

## Shop Integration

### Hardware Items
- **WiFi Scanner v1** → unlocks `scan`
- **WiFi Adapter v2** → unlocks `extended_scan`
- **WiFi Suite v3** → unlocks `wifi_monitor`
- **WiFi Array v4** → unlocks `spoof`
- **ESP32 Basic v1** → unlocks `test`
- **ESP32 Dev v2** → unlocks `iot_hack`, `sensor_spoof`

### Software Items
- **Data Scraper v1** → unlocks `extract_data`
- **Data Extractor v2** → unlocks `file_recovery`
- **Network Scanner v1** → unlocks `nmap`, `trace`
- **Password Cracker v1** → unlocks `crack`
- **Keylogger Suite v1** → unlocks `keylog`
- **Exploit Framework v1** → unlocks `exploit`, `inject`

## Terminal Integration

### Updated Terminal Component
- Modified `Terminal.tsx` to use the new `isCommandAvailable` function
- Ensures all initial commands are unlocked for new players
- Provides clear error messages for locked commands
- Imports the necessary functions from the commands module

### Command Execution Flow
1. Check if command exists
2. Check if command is available to the player
3. Execute command if available
4. Show appropriate error message if locked

## Validation System

### Comprehensive Validation Script
Created `check_command_system.cjs` that validates:
- All commands have proper `unlockLevel` properties
- Shop items only unlock commands that exist
- Shop exclusive commands have corresponding shop items
- No duplicate commands exist
- Proper categorization of all commands

### Validation Results
✅ **58 total commands** properly categorized
✅ **0 missing unlockLevel** properties
✅ **All shop items** unlock existing commands
✅ **All shop exclusive commands** have corresponding shop items
✅ **No duplicate commands** found

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Unlock System**: All commands now have proper unlock levels
2. **Shop Integration**: Shop items properly unlock the correct commands
3. **Mission Progression**: Commands unlock at appropriate mission levels
4. **Faction System**: Special commands reserved for faction progression
5. **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when commands are locked
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing system to prevent future issues

## Files Modified

- `client/src/lib/commands.ts` - Added unlock levels and availability system
- `client/src/lib/shop/items.ts` - Fixed shop items to unlock correct commands
- `client/src/components/Terminal.tsx` - Updated to use new availability system
- `check_command_system.cjs` - Created validation script

## Future Considerations

- Blackmarket items removed (were unlocking non-existent commands)
- System is extensible for adding new commands and unlock mechanisms
- Validation script can be run anytime to ensure system integrity
- Mission system integration ready for command unlocking

The command unlock system is now fully functional and properly integrated with your game's progression mechanics!
